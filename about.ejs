        <div class="about_txt"> <h1>London</h1>
            <p>"London" is an ancient name, already attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form 
                Londinium;[60] for example, handwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70-80 
                include the word Londinio ("in London").[61]
                Over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears 
                in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136.[60] This had it that the 
                name originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud.[62]
                Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early 
                sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with 
                reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed 
                that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the 
                lost Celtic form of the name as *[Londonjon] or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as 
                Londinium and borrowed into Old English, the ancestor-language of English.[63] </p><br>
                <h1>Chisinau</h1>
            <p>The origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the archaic 
                Romanian word chișla (meaning "spring", "source of water") and nouă ("new"), because it was built around 
                a small spring, at the corner of Pușkin and Albișoara streets.[10]

                The other version, formulated by Ștefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds that the 
                name was formed the same way as the name of Chișineu (alternative spelling: Chișinău) in Western 
                Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is Kisjenő, from which the Romanian name originates.[11] Kisjenő comes from kis "small" and the Jenő, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jenő tribe.[12][13]
                
                Chișinău is known in Russian as Кишинёв (Kishinjóv), while Moldova's Russian-language media call 
                it Кишинэу, [kʲɪʂɨˈnɛʊ] (Kishineu). It is written Kişinöv in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was 
                also written as Chișineu in pre-20th-century Romanian[14] and as Кишинэу in the Moldovan Cyrillic 
                alphabet. Historically, the English language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified 
                Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chișinău was part of the 
                Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical 
                contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based Chișinău has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially 
                in written language. The city is also historically referred to as German: Kischinau, Polish: Kiszyniów, 
                Ukrainian: Кишинів, romanized: Kyshyniv, or Yiddish: קעשענעװ‎, romanized: Keshenev.  </p><br>
                <h1>Moscow</h1>
            <p>The name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the Moskva River.[35][36] There have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river. Finno-Ugric Merya and Muroma people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river supposedly Mustajoki, in English: Black river. It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term.[37][38]

                The most linguistically well grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root *mŭzg-/muzg- from the Proto-Indo-European *meu- "wet",[36][39][40] so the name Moskva might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh.[35] Its cognates include Russian: музга, muzga "pool, puddle", Lithuanian: mazgoti and Latvian: mazgāt "to wash", Sanskrit: májjati "to drown", Latin: mergō "to dip, immerse".[35][39] In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine and North Macedonia.[41] There exist as well similar place names in Poland like Mozgawa.[35][36][39]
                
                The original Old Russian form of the name is reconstructed as *Москы, *Mosky,[35][36] hence it was one of a few Slavic ū-stem nouns. As with other nouns of that declension, it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language, as a result the first written mentions in the 12th century were Московь, Moskovĭ (accusative case), Москви, Moskvi (locative case), Москвe/Москвѣ, Moskve/Moskvě (genitive case).[35][36] From the latter forms came the modern Russian name Москва, Moskva, which is a result of morphological generalisation with the numerous Slavic ā-stem nouns.
                
                However, the form Moskovĭ has left some traces in many other languages, such as English: Moscow, German: Moskau, French: Moscou, Georgian: მოსკოვი, Latvian: Maskava, Ottoman Turkish: Moskov, Tatar: Мәскәү, Mäskäw, Kazakh: Мәскеу, Mäskew, Chuvash: Мускав, Muskav, etc. In a similar manner the Latin name Moscovia has been formed, later it became a colloquial name for Russia used in Western Europe in the 16th–17th centuries. From it as well came English Muscovy and muscovite.[42] </p><br>
                <h1>New York</h1>
            <p>In the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.[45]

                The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown.[46] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême).[47] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (Saint Anthony's River). The Padrón Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor.[48]
                
                In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[49] He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as "a very good Harbour for all windes" and the river as "a mile broad" and "full of fish".[50] Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles (240 km) north,[51] past the site of the present-day New York State capital city of Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.[50] He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland).
                
                The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.[5 </p><br>
                <h1>Paris</h1>
            <p>The name 'Paris' is derived from its early inhabitants, the Gallic Parisii tribe.[14] The meaning of the Gaulish name Parisii is debated.[14][15] According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the root pario- ('cauldron').[14] Alfred Holder interpreted Parisii as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing the name to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), from paraf - peri ('to make, produce, command to be done').[15] The city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology.

                Paris is often referred to as the 'City of Light' (La Ville Lumière),[16] both because of its leading role during the Age of Enlightenment and more literally because Paris was one of the first large European cities to use gas street lighting on a grand scale on its boulevards and monuments. Gas lights were installed on the Place du Carousel, Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome in 1829. By 1857, the Grand boulevards were lit.[17] By the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps.[18] Since the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.[19]
                
                Inhabitants are known in English as "Parisians" and in French as Parisiens</p><br>
